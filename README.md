A data challenge from watchtower

# Descriptions

Thank you for your interest in our Data Scientist role at Watchtower (www.watchtower.ai). The following project is designed to help us gain familiarity with your data science expertise. We want to be mindful of your time so please see how much of the project you can complete in roughly 3 hours of work. Please plan to send your results to us in 72 hours, and donâ€™t hesitate to reach out to us if you have any questions - we are happy to help. 

# Task

1. Scrape 500 pages of a specific category on Wikipedia. For example, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Medicine

2. Build a graph where the nodes represent pages and the edges represent the semantic distance between those pages. Please keep just the 10 nearest neighbors for each node.

3. Create a visualization of your results. 

4. Please share your work with us (e.g. Jupyter notebook, etc.) with a brief write-up of your results.
